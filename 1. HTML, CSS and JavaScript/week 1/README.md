## What to Submit in assessment

There are 3 parts of this assessment. You will need to submit 3 files in total, one for each part. Each subsequent part builds upon the previous part.

For Part 1, you need to create the web page content without style. Make sure you save a copy of this as, for example, part1.html, before you move on to the next part.

For Part 2, take your part 1 file and extend it by applying style. Make sure you save a copy of this as, for example, part2.html, before you move on to the next part.

For Part 3, take your part 2 file and extend it to include the interactive features. Save this as part3.html.

For Parts 2 and 3, please note that all style rules are to be included in the style section, and there should be no use of inline style.
